UPDATE FROM 1.3 to 1.4
=======================

### General ###

  * A general info:

    Lorem Ipsum

  * Another one

    Lorem Ipsum


### Products ###

  * Product group permissions

    You can now limit the access to product groups. An outcome of this new feature is that you can't have any product assigned to no product group
    at all anymore. The update will take care of that for you.


### Checkout ###

  * Addresses are now formatted using hCard markup. You might need to adjust the checkout review step using CSS.


### Hooks ###

  * The parameter list of "addCustomAddress" hook has changed! The third parameter is now the default address, the module ($this) has moved to the fourth position.
